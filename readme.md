### What i have learned:

1. Neural network architecture and how it is constructed using neurons.

2. Different types of activation functions, such as the sigmoid function, and their role in neural networks.

3. The concept of a dataset and how it is used in training a neural network.

4. Loss functions, such as the mean squared error (MSE), and their role in quantifying the difference between the network's output and the true label.

5. Techniques for optimizing a neural network, including backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.

6. How to evaluate the performance of a neural network and prevent overfitting.

7. Common architectures of neural networks, such as feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.

8. Applications of neural networks in different fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.
